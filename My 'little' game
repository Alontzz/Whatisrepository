SO this is my first solo tryout at programming. 
It's a text based game(like zork--which i played...could NOT get past the troll).
There are 8https://github.com/Alontzz/Whatisrepository/new/master# rooms, all is done inside fucktions and moving around usind calls.
It's robust and a work in progress.




print "\n\n\n\nthe game has the following commands: take 'object'(or take all), look(or l), drop 'object' (or drop all), inventory(or i),yes(or y), no(or n),. Moving about in the game : North, south, east, west OR n, s, w, e. \n\n\n\t\tNow a short intro:"

print "\t\n You are a treasure hunter from europe who has heard\n rumours of treasue, north-west of Moghareh oasis. \nYou prepare yourself like usual for the climate and conditions to where you go.\nYou hire an egyptian to show you the way.\nFinally after 6 months of preparations\nyou arrive at the sand dunes which should hold the treasure you seek .
